# AppBox SDK for iOS

## Introduction
Add AppBox SDK in your development/adhoc/enterprises iOS apps to get automatic update for apps uploaded via [AppBox-iOSAppsWirelessInstallation](http://tryappbox.com/).

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, please make sure that the following prerequisites are met:
* [AppBox for Mac](http://tryappbox.com/download)
* An iOS project that is set up in Xcode 7.0 on macOS 10.10 or later.
* The minimum OS target supported by the AppBox SDK is iOS 8.0 or later.
* If you are using cocoapods, please use cocoapods 1.1.1 or later.
* This readme assumes that you are using Objective-C or Swift 3 syntax and that you want to integrate all services.

## Integrate the SDK (using Cocoapods)

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like AppBox in your projects. To learn how to setup CocoaPods for your project, visit [the official CocoaPods website](http://cocoapods.org/).

1. Add the following to your podfile to include all services into your app. This will pull in AppBox SDK.

    ```ruby
    platform :ios, '8.0'
    use_frameworks! 

    target '{Your Target Name}' do
      pod 'AppBox'
    end
    ```

1. Run pod install to install your newly defined pod, open your .xcworkspace and it's time to start the SDK and make use of the AppBox SDK.

## Start the SDK

To start the AppBox SDK in your app, follow these steps:

### 1. Get App Update Key
*  In order to use AppBox auto update service, you need to get app update key. For app update key, you need to upload your app with [AppBox](http://tryappbox.com) option [Keep same link url for all future build](http://www.tryappbox.com/features/keepsamelink/)

* When upload is complete, you'll get the a short url like this `http://appstorebeta.com/bMNpEVjudM`. Open this url in your macOS web browser. Here you will see a long url like this `http://i.tryappbox.com/?url=%2Fs%2F49lsofdx9lsi61j%2Fappinfo.json`.
* In long url after `%2Fs%2F` and before `%2Fappinfo.json` is your app update key, i.e - `49lsofdx9lsi61j` in this case. Use your's.

### 2. Add import statements

You need to add import statements for AppBox modules before starting the SDK.

#### Objective-C
Open your `AppDelegate.m` file and add the following line at the top of the file below your own import statements.

```objective-c
#import <AppBox/AppBox.h>
```

#### Swift
Open your `AppDelegate.swift` file and add the following line.

```swift
import AppBox
```

### 3. Start the SDK

In order to use AppBox auto update service, you need to -

#### Objective-C
Add the following line to start the SDK in your app's `AppDelegate.m` class in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method.

```objective-c
[AppNewVersionNotifier initWithKey:"{App Update Key}"];
```
#### Swift
Insert the following line to start the SDK in your app's `AppDelegate.swift` class in the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method.

```swift
AppNewVersionNotifier.initWithKey("{App Update Key}")
```

## Troubleshooting

**Q. Unable to find a specification for AppBox error when using CocoaPods in your app?**

If you are using Cocoapods to install AppBox SDK in your app and run into an error with the message - Unable to find a specification for AppBox, run `pod repo update` or `pod repo update master` in your terminal. It will sync the latest podspec files for you. Then try `pod install` which should install AppBox SDK in your app.

**Q. Swift. Could not build objective-c module 'AppBox'**

When this happens, just build the frameworks separately first :
* Change the scheme to `AppBox` (if not present then select from manage scheme)
* Build (‚åòB)
* Change back to your project scheme
* Run
